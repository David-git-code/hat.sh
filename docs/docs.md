# [Introduction](#introduction)
---

 Hat.sh is a free opensource web app that provides secure file encryption in the browser. 


<br>

# [Features](#features)
---

### Security


- [XChaCha20-Poly1305] - for symmetric encryption.
- [Argon2id] - for password-based key derivation.


The libsodium library is used for all cryptographic algorithms. technical details here.

<br>

### Privacy

- The app runs locally in your browser.
- No data is ever collected or sent to anyone.â€‹

# [Installation](#installation)
---

Download or clone the repository

```bash
git clone --branch v2-beta https://github.com/sh-dv/hat.sh.git hat.sh-v2-beta
```

<br>

Go to the app directory

```bash

```

<br>

Open terminal and install the packages

```bash
npm install
```

<br>

Run the app in dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should be running on https://localhost:3000


<br>

If you wish to build and export the app. run :

```bash
npm run build
```

# [Usage](#usage)
---

### File Encryption

1. Open hat.sh
2. Navigate to the Encryption panel
3. Drag & Drop or Select the file that you wish to encrypt
4. Enter the encryption password
5. Download the encrypted file

>You should always use a strong password!



### File Decryption

1. Open hat.sh
2. Navigate to the Decryption panel
3. Drag & Drop or Select the file that you wish to decrypt
4. Enter the decryption password
5. Download the decrypted file


<br>

# [Limitations](#limitations)
---

### Folder & Multiple Files Encryption

This feature is not available for security reasons. If you wish to encrypt a whole directory or multiple files then you should make a Zip and encrypt it.

### File Metadata

Files encrypted with the app are identifiable by looking at the file signature that is used by the app to verify the content of a file, Such signatures are also known as magic numbers or Magic Bytes. These Bytes are authenticated and cannot be changed. 


### Safari and Mobile Browsers

Safari and Mobile browsers are limited to a file size of 1GB due to some issues related to service-workers. In addition, this limitation also applies when the app fails to register the service-worker (e.g FireFox Private Browsing).

# [Best Practices](#best-practices)
---

### Choosing Passwords
The majority of individuals struggle to create and remember passwords, resulting in weak passwords and password reuse. Password-based encryption is substantially less safe as a result of these improper practices. That's why it is recommended to use a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), where you are able to generate and store a safe password.  

<br>

If you want to choose a password that you are able to memorize then you should type a passphrase made of 8 words or more.

### Sharing Encrypted Files

If you plan on sending the file you have encrypted, you can do that in any safe file sharing app.

### Sharing Decryption Passwords
Sharing decryption password can be done using a safe end-to-end encrypted messaging app. It's recommended to use a *Disappearing Messages* feature, and to delete the password after the recepient has decrypted the file. 

>Never choose the same password for different files.

### When should I not use hat.sh?

1. If you want to encrypt a disk (e.g [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.fr)).
2. If you want to Frequently access encrypted files (e.g [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)).
3. If you want to encrypt multiple files and directories at once (e.g [Kryptor](https://github.com/samuel-lucas6/Kryptor)).
4. If you want to encrypt files for another person that only they can decrypt (e.g [Kryptor](https://github.com/samuel-lucas6/Kryptor)).
5. If you want something that adheres to industry standards, use [GPG](https://gnupg.org/).
