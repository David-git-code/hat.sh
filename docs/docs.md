# [Usage](#usage)

---

### File Encryption

1. Open hat.sh
2. Navigate to the Encryption panel
3. Drag & Drop or Select the file that you wish to encrypt
4. Enter the encryption password
5. Download the encrypted file

> You should always use a strong password!

### File Decryption

1. Open hat.sh
2. Navigate to the Decryption panel
3. Drag & Drop or Select the file that you wish to decrypt
4. Enter the decryption password
5. Download the decrypted file

<br>

# [Limitations](#limitations)

---

### Folder & Multiple Files Encryption

This feature is not available for security reasons. If you wish to encrypt a whole directory or multiple files then you should make a Zip and encrypt it.

### File Metadata

Files encrypted with the app are identifiable by looking at the file signature that is used by the app to verify the content of a file, Such signatures are also known as magic numbers or Magic Bytes. These Bytes are authenticated and cannot be changed.

### Safari and Mobile Browsers

Safari and Mobile browsers are limited to a file size of 1GB due to some issues related to service-workers. In addition, this limitation also applies when the app fails to register the service-worker (e.g FireFox Private Browsing).

<br>

# [Best Practices](#best-practices)

---

### Choosing Passwords

The majority of individuals struggle to create and remember passwords, resulting in weak passwords and password reuse. Password-based encryption is substantially less safe as a result of these improper practices. That's why it is recommended to use the built in password generator and use a password manager like [Bitwarden], where you are able to store the safe password.

<br>

If you want to choose a password that you are able to memorize then you should type a passphrase made of 8 words or more.

### Sharing Encrypted Files

If you plan on sending the file you have encrypted, you can do that in any safe file sharing app.

### Sharing Decryption Passwords

Sharing decryption password can be done using a safe end-to-end encrypted messaging app. It's recommended to use a _Disappearing Messages_ feature, and to delete the password after the recepient has decrypted the file.

> Never choose the same password for different files.

<br>

### Password hashing and Key derivation

Password hashing functions derive a secret key of any size from a password and a salt.


```javascript
let salt = sodium.randombytes_buf(sodium.crypto_pwhash_SALTBYTES);
let key = sodium.crypto_pwhash(
  sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_KEYBYTES,
  password,
  salt,
  sodium.crypto_pwhash_OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE,
  sodium.crypto_pwhash_MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE,
  sodium.crypto_pwhash_ALG_ARGON2ID13
);
```

The `crypto_pwhash()` function derives an 256 bits long key from a password and a salt salt whose fixed length is 128 bits, which should be unpredictable.

`randombytes_buf()` is the easiest way to fill the 128 bits of the salt.

<br>

`OPSLIMIT` represents a maximum amount of computations to perform.

`MEMLIMIT` is the maximum amount of RAM that the function will use, in bytes.

<br>

`crypto_pwhash_OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE` and `crypto_pwhash_MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE` provide base line for these two parameters. This currently requires 64 MiB of dedicated RAM. which is suitable for in-browser operations.
<br>
`crypto_pwhash_ALG_ARGON2ID13` using the Argon2id algorithm version 1.3.

<br>

### File Encryption (stream)

In order to use the app to encrypt a file, the user has to provide a valid file and a password. this password gets hashed and a secure key is derived from it with Argon2id to encrypt the file.

```javascript
let res = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_push(key);
header = res.header;
state = res.state;

let tag = last
  ? sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_FINAL
  : sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_MESSAGE;

let encryptedChunk = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_push(
  state,
  new Uint8Array(chunk),
  null,
  tag
);

stream.enqueue(signature, salt, header, encryptedChunk);
```

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_push` function creates an encrypted stream where it initializes a `state` using the key and an internal, automatically generated initialization vector. It then stores the stream header into `header` that has a size of 192 bits.



This is the first function to call in order to create an encrypted stream. The key will not be required any more for subsequent operations.

<br>

An encrypted stream starts with a short header, whose size is 192 bits. That header must be sent/stored before the sequence of encrypted messages, as it is required to decrypt the stream. The header content doesn't have to be secret because decryption with a different header would fail.



A tag is attached to each message accoring to the value of `last`, which indicates if that is the last chunk of the file or not. That tag can be any of:


1. `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_MESSAGE`: This doesn't add any information about the nature of the message.
2. `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_FINAL`: This indicates that the message marks the end of the stream, and erases the secret key used to encrypt the previous sequence.


The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_push()` function encrypts the file `chunk` using the `state` and the `tag`, without any additional information (`null`).
<br>

the XChaCha20 stream cipher Poly1305 MAC authentication are used for encryption.


`stream.enqueue()` function adds the hat.sh signature(magic bytes), salt and header followed by the encrypted chunks.

### File Decryption (stream)

```javascript
let state = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_pull(header, key);

let result = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_pull(
  state,
  new Uint8Array(chunk)
);

if (result) {
  let decryptedChunk = result.message;
  stream.enqueue(decryptedChunk);

  if (!last) {
    // continue decryption
  }
}
```

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_pull()` function initializes a state given a secret `key` and a `header`. The key is derived from the password provided during the decryption, and the header sliced from the file. The key will not be required any more for subsequent operations.

<br>

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_pull()` function verifies that the `chunk` contains a valid ciphertext and authentication tag for the given `state`.

This function will stay in a loop, until a message with the `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_FINAL` tag is found.

If the decryption key is incorrect the function returns an error.

If the ciphertext or the authentication tag appear to be invalid it returns an error.

### XChaCha20-Poly1305

XChaCha20 is a variant of ChaCha20 with an extended nonce, allowing random nonces to be safe.

XChaCha20 doesn't require any lookup tables and avoids the possibility of timing attacks.

Internally, XChaCha20 works like a block cipher used in counter mode. It uses the HChaCha20 hash function to derive a subkey and a subnonce from the original key and extended nonce, and a dedicated 64-bit block counter to avoid incrementing the nonce after each block.

<br>

XChaCha20 is generally recommended over plain ChaCha20 due to its extended nonce size, and its comparable performance.

Authentication used is Poly1305, a Wegman-Carter authenticator designed by D. J. Bernstein.

Poly1305 takes a 256 bit, one-time key and a message and produces a 128 bit tag that authenticates the message such that an attacker has a negligible chance of producing a valid tag for a inauthentic message.

Poly1305 keys have to be secret, unpredictable and unique.

<br>

The XChaCha20-Poly1305 construction can safely encrypt a practically unlimited number of messages with the same key, without any practical limit to the size of a message. As an alternative to counters, its large nonce size (192-bit) allows random nonces to be safely used.

XChaCha20-Poly1305 applies the construction described in Daniel Bernstein's [Extending the Salsa20 nonce paper] to the ChaCha20 cipher in order to extend the nonce size to 192-bit.

This extended nonce size allows random nonces to be safely used, and also facilitates the construction of misuse-resistant schemes.

<br>

The XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation in libsodium is portable across all supported architectures and It will [soon] become an IETF standard.

- Encryption: XChaCha20 stream cipher
- Authentication: Poly1305 MAC

### V2 vs V1

- switching to xchacha20poly1305 for symmetric stream encryption and Argon2id for password-based key derivation. instead of AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2.
- using the libsodium library for all cryptography instead of the WebCryptoApi.
- in this version, the app doesn't read the whole file in memory. instead, it's sliced into 64MB chunks that are processed one by one.
- since we are not using any server-side processing, the app registers a fake download URL (/file) that is going to be handled by the service-worker fetch api.
- if all validations are passed, a new stream is initialized. then, file chunks are transferred from the main app to the
  service-worker file via messages.
- each chunk is encrypted/decrypted on it's own and added to the stream.
- after each chunk is written on disk it is going to be immediately garbage collected by the browser, this leads to never having more than a few chunks in the memory at the same time.
