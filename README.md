this beta version demonstrates memory efficient large file chunked encryption using streams with libsodium.js 
(with xchacha20poly1305 and argon2id)



## What's new in v2

- switching to xchacha20poly1305 for symmetric stream encryption and Argon2id for password-based key derivation. instead of AES-256-GCM and PBKDF2.
- using the libsodium library for all cryptography instead of the WebCryptoApi.
- in this version, the app doesn't read the whole file in memory. instead, it's sliced into 64MB chunks that are processed one by one.
- since we are not using any server-side processing, the app registers a fake download URL (/file) that is going to be handled by the service-worker fetch api.
- if all validations are passed, a new stream is initialized. then, file chunks are transferred from the main app to the 
service-worker file via messages.
- each chunk is encrypted/decrypted on it's on and added to the stream.
- after each chunk is written on disk it is going to be immediately garbage collected by the browser, this leads to never having more than a few chunks in the memory at the same time.

## To Do üë®‚Äçüíª
- handle stream back pressures

## Installation

Download or clone the repository

    git clone --branch v2-beta https://github.com/sh-dv/hat.sh.git hat.sh-v2-beta

go to the app directory

    cd hat.sh-v2-beta or [app directory]

open terminal and install the node modules that are in the package.json file

    npm install

run the app in dev mode

    npm run dev


should be running on http://localhost:3000



## Browser Compatibility
- check out [service-worker fetch event compatibility.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent)
- Safari and Mobile Broswers are supported but with a file size limitation (File Size up to 1GB)
